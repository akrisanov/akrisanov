### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Andrey

CTO at [planfact.io](https://planfact.io), leading a 25-person engineering team behind a profitable B2B SaaS with $3M+ ARR. I bring 15+ years of backend experience and have led engineering efforts across fintech, retail, and privacy-tech startups in Russia and Europe. My focus: scalable systems, developer velocity, and product-aligned architecture.

I'm also building expertise in [inference systems](https://github.com/akrisanov/inference-engineering-journey) and platform engineering, with a strong interest in performance, scalability, and cloud-native infrastructure.
